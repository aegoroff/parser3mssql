Build requirements:

1. Visual Studio 2012

2. PARSER3PROJECT environment variable that points to parser sources directory. 
According to parser's build rules it's parser3project directory in the root directory of any drive. 
For example if this directory is on the D drive, environment variable must be D:\parser3project

3. SQL_SDK_ROOT environment variable that points to MS SQL SDK 
(Native client installs this), 
usually C:\Program Files\Microsoft SQL Server\90\SDK
